# Qualitor-QCrypt-Decoder
Simple qcrypt decoder for Qualitor Software.

At some point I did a pentest on a web software called Qualitor. After fixing some of the vulnerabilities, they added a type of encryption to the GET and POST parameters.

This made it very difficult to perform new exploits since I didn't know the content of the requests. After analyzing it more deeply, I understood how the "encryption" worked and I wrote a script to encode and decode this information.
